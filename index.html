      <h1>South Asia Speaks: The Lived Experiences of Home</h1>
      <h2>By Natasha Karunaratne & Natasha Khwaja</h2>

        &ldquo;They have no idea what it is like to lose home at the risk of never finding home again, have your entire life split between two lands and become the bridge between two countries.&rdquo;
        <br />
        &mdash; Rupi Kaur, Milk &amp; Honey
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        As college students of South Asian origin, many of us consider this campus home. The lawns littered with leaves in the fall and the white and brick buildings illuminated against the sunset have become pieces of who we are. Our other pieces, however, are strewn across a land of arbitrary borders drawn with British pens and discourses of animosity spiraled out of biased histories and political narratives. So here, as college students in this post-election moment of uncertainty and pain, we are urged to tell the stories of how our identities have been crafted from the remains of the many places our forbearers have called home. This political climate heightens what South Asians have always been subjugated to feel&mdash;that America is not our home. Now, through our storytelling, we begin to define our own home.
      </p>

      <div class="pullquote">
        Home and Identity
      </div>

      <p>
        Here in this US, one&rsquo;s ethnic or cultural identity is tightly bound to the political boundaries of the nation-state&mdash;it&rsquo;s common to hear people say they are &ldquo;insert country name here&rdquo; American, asserting their hyphenated transnational identity. And while the validity of this assertion is being increasingly accepted, its widespread use is complicated when it comes to South Asia. Here, we see a collection of states whose borders were drawn by the British and the disarray they left in their crown jewel after 1947 with Partition and ensuing civil wars. A collection of states whose existence has been scarred by decades of conflict under the guise of religion and other categories of enumeration imposed under colonial rule. The people who fall within these borders have cultural ties to ethno-linguistic groups that penetrate political lines. They carry legacies of conflict that challenge the ability for Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to progress collectively as &ldquo;South Asia.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When our families came to the US, they came scarred and burdened with identities that emerged from regional bloodshed. Among more practical motivations, they came to escape this legacy and a social structure still steeped in caste and privileging certain regions over others, only to be greeted by an entirely new unit of oppression: race. Coming to America, South Asians are faced with the same systematic oppression they fought so hard to be free of, but this time it&rsquo;s wrapped up in the American Dream. It&rsquo;s important to consider how identity politics relate to South Asian immigrants. Rooted in a sense of unfamiliarity with the American social landscape, first generation immigrants are often apathetic to US racial politics, which center on a minority-majority dynamic&mdash;something foreign to South Asians. As a result, we tend toward nostalgia, idealizing South Asia as home rather than confronting the discrimination and otherness we feel in our American homes.
      </p>

      <div class="pullquote">
        Our Changing Perceptions of Home
      </div>

      <p>
        As members of diaspora, our sense of home is often composed of our loved ones&rsquo; perceptions of home. There is a sense of modern nostalgia as our versions of ancestry.com are our aunties and uncles&rsquo; stories of leaving home. And while these stories are richer in empathy and pure emotion than any textbook&rsquo;s description of the Potato Famine, the oral histories that we hold so dear are limited by their filtration through others&rsquo; lenses. Our memories of South Asia are the memories of those before us and our memories of America are stripped from us every time someone asks us <span class="italic">where are you from?</span> and insinuates that the answer is certainly not here. The only place we can exist in is the clouds between these lands with a foggy perception of home, which can evaporate any day now.
      </p>

      <div class="pullquote">
        Defining Home in Today&rsquo;s America
      </div>

      <p>
        For many of us who find ourselves floating between the borders of America and South Asia, the multiple pieces of our identities always feel like halves, and never feel like wholes, even when pieced together. While we can be proud of our heritage and try our best to chip away at the internalized icicles that exist within us to make us hate our racialization and our roots, there will always be frozen water pouring down on us, making the icicle bigger and bigger until we are utterly ashamed. As artist and activist Fatimah Asghar perfectly iterated, &ldquo;This is what being brown in America is all about: being invisible and erased until one day, someone who maybe looks like you does something bad, and there you are, in the world&rsquo;s spotlight, everyone&rsquo;s daggers pointed at you.&rdquo; Being Brown in America isn&rsquo;t about how we perceive our identity&mdash;it&rsquo;s about how America perceives us. And we will always be seen as the perpetual foreigner: one who never has a home. Every day too many of us hear &ldquo;go back home&rdquo; when we don&rsquo;t always know where or what home is. For us, defining home and owning our own perceptions of ourselves is resistance.
      </p>

      <p>
        We tell our stories to reaffirm that only we can define our home. That while we carry legacies that confuse us and often inhibit our stories from being told together, by humanizing the narrative we aim to reclaim it. Everyone has a different way of articulating their story&mdash;for some it&rsquo;s always on their minds, academically and internally, while for others, it comes less naturally. Ultimately, there is beauty, power, and room for continued exploration in both, and we hope this will inspire all folks to discover their stories and draw collective strength from our words, especially when navigating the otherness and fear consuming us in this post-election climate.
